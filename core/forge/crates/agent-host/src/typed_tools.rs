//! Scope-derived tools for Forge-hosted native Agent Runtime sessions.
//!
//! The runtime deliberately knows nothing about Forge identities, Projects,
//! Agent Chats, or Task roles. This module is the narrow host-owned composition
//! boundary: it turns one server-authorized canonical scope into an exact tool
//! registry and an authoritative security check.  Callers never provide the
//! actor or scope as tool arguments; those values are captured when the host
//! composes the tools.
