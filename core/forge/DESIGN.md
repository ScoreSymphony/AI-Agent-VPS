# Forge Design System

## 1. Atmosphere & Identity

Forge is a focused foundry: calm, compact operational surfaces in warm stone and charcoal, with an ember-orange accent that signals action and live work. Its signature is the ember edge—a restrained orange rail, glow, or focus treatment that makes active work legible without turning the board into a decorative dashboard.

## 2. Color

Colors are implemented as HSL component custom properties in `web/src/index.css` and consumed through semantic Tailwind names. Alpha variants of these tokens are allowed; new raw colors are not.

### Palette

| Role           | Token                                         |                    Light |                      Dark | Usage                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -----------------------: | ------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Canvas         | `background` / `--background`                 |              `60 9% 98%` |               `20 13% 5%` | Application and board canvas                                  |

| Sidebar active | `sidebar-active` / `--sidebar-active`         |             `25 95% 53%` |              `25 95% 53%` | Active navigation marker                                      |
| Ember surface  | `ember-surface` / `--ember-surface`           | `rgba(234, 88, 12, .08)` | `rgba(249, 115, 22, .08)` | Quiet active backgrounds                                      |
| Ember border   | `ember-border` / `--ember-border`             | `rgba(234, 88, 12, .22)` | `rgba(249, 115, 22, .22)` | Active borders                                                |

### Rules

- Use semantic Tailwind tokens rather than literal colors in components.
- Ember is reserved for primary action, focus, active navigation, current work, and drag/drop intent.
- Destructive red communicates failure; warning communicates a stale-board conflict that can be reconciled.
- Light and dark modes must expose the same semantic hierarchy and interaction states.

## 3. Typography

### Font stacks

- Primary: `Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`.
- Mono: `JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, ui-monospace, monospace`.
- No serif family is used.

### Scale

| Token / utility | Size | Line height | Typical use                                          |
| --------------- | ---: | ----------: | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `text-micro`    | 10px |         1.2 | Uppercase column labels, counters, compact metadata  |
| `text-xs`       | 12px |        1rem | Secondary labels and dense controls                  |
| `text-ui`       | 13px |        1.45 | Default board cards, menus, and operational controls |
| `text-sm`       | 14px |     1.25rem | Body copy and standard controls                      |
| `text-base`     | 16px |      1.5rem | Dialog titles and emphasized body copy               |
| `text-lg`       | 18px |     1.75rem | Section headings                                     |
| `text-page`     | 22px |         1.3 | Page title                                           |
| `text-2xl`      | 24px |        2rem | Large card/page headings where already established   |

Weights are regular 400, medium 500, semibold 600, and bold 700. Operational overlines use the mono family, semibold weight, uppercase text, and `0.8px` to `1.2px` tracking.

## 4. Spacing & Layout

### Base unit

All new spacing is based on 4px. Existing 2px and 6px compact gaps are accepted legacy half-step values and must not spread into new layout primitives.

| Token       | Value | Usage                                        |
| ----------- | ----: | -------------------------------------------- |
| `space-0.5` |   2px | Existing dense list separation only          |
| `space-1`   |   4px | Icon insets and tight groups                 |
| `space-1.5` |   6px | Existing card metadata gaps                  |
| `space-2`   |   8px | Compact control and card spacing             |
| `space-2.5` |  10px | Existing dense card padding                  |
| `space-3`   |  12px | Inputs and toolbar groups                    |
| `space-4`   |  16px | Mobile page/board padding and dialog spacing |
| `space-5`   |  20px | Desktop content padding                      |
| `space-6`   |  24px | Comfortable panel padding                    |
| `space-8`   |  32px | Major component separation                   |

### Shell and board geometry

- Viewport shell: `min-height: 100vh` fallback plus `100dvh`; the page itself never owns horizontal overflow.
- Shell modes: full 240px navigation at `>=1440px`; 56px rail from `1024px` through `1439px`; closed overlay drawer below `1024px`.
- A user-expanded rail may temporarily render the full navigation without rewriting the persisted wide-desktop preference.
- Board route main: `min-width: 0`, no scrolling, and no generic page padding. Other routes retain the existing 20px content padding and main scroll.
- Board page: toolbar is fixed above a single `min-height: 0` board viewport. The viewport owns both horizontal and vertical drag scrolling.
- Columns: `min-width: 220px` at 1280px, a comfortable tablet width that allows at least two columns at 768px, and `min-width: 280px` at 375px. Column/task-list children never establish another scroll container.
- Board padding/gaps use 16px at mobile/tablet and 20px at desktop, with 8px to 12px column gaps.
- Card width follows its column and must remain at least 280px on a 375px viewport after board padding.

## 5. Components

### Button and icon button

- **Structure:** semantic `button`, optional Phosphor icon, label or accessible name.
- **Variants:** primary, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link; text and icon sizes.
- **States:** default, hover, active press, visible focus ring, disabled opacity/cursor, pending/busy.
- **Accessibility:** icon-only controls require an accessible name; disabled state uses native `disabled` where possible.
- **Motion:** color/opacity/transform only, using the micro timing token.

### Form controls

- **Structure:** label plus input/select/textarea/checkbox/switch, supporting help and error text.
- **States:** default, hover where relevant, focus ring, disabled, invalid, loading where asynchronous.
- **Accessibility:** programmatic label, described errors, keyboard operation, and contrast in both themes.

### Card and panel

- **Structure:** semantic section/article with optional header, content, metadata, and actions.
- **Variants:** standard card, compact operational card, elevated popover/dialog.
- **States:** default, hover elevation, active/selected ember treatment, disabled/muted, loading skeleton, empty, error.
- **Depth:** subtle border plus tokenized shadow; do not add isolated shadow recipes.

### App shell navigation

- **Structure:** skip link, navigation, header, and main landmark.
- **Variants:** full sidebar, compact rail, overlay drawer.
- **States:** active item, hover, focus, drawer open/closed, persisted desktop collapse preference.
- **Accessibility:** drawer traps/contains focus through existing dialog/sheet behavior, closes on Escape and outside click, and returns focus to its menu trigger.
- **Motion:** drawer/rail transitions use standard timing, transform, and opacity; reduced motion removes non-essential movement.

### Board toolbar

- **Structure:** page identity, search/filter controls, create action, and a polite status/explanation region.
- **States:** default, filtering, ordering-disabled, committing, conflict, loading, and error.
- **Accessibility:** ordering eligibility is visible text and announced; non-ordering controls remain usable during a move.

### Board viewport and column

- **Structure:** one scroll-owning board viewport containing non-scrolling droppable columns.
- **States:** loading skeleton, empty board/column, error, valid drop target, active drop target, ordering-disabled, and committing.
- **Accessibility:** named regions/columns; board status is announced without stealing focus.
- **Responsive:** follows the column widths and padding in Section 4 without document overflow.

### Kanban task card

- **Structure:** draggable article, detail-navigation body, status/assignment metadata, dedicated drag handle, and overflow menu.
- **States:** default, hover, active press, keyboard focus within, dragging, committing/busy, disabled ordering, blocked/error, terminal-muted.
- **Accessibility:** the card body and drag handle are separate targets; the handle is a visible button-like control with an accessible name and at least a 32px target. Keyboard drag uses the DnD library controls.
- **Motion:** hover/drag uses tokenized shadow plus transform/opacity; active in-progress ember motion respects reduced motion.

### Drag handle

- **Structure:** Phosphor grip icon in a dedicated 32px control; only this control receives `dragHandleProps`.
- **States:** subtle default, visible hover, active press, high-contrast focus ring, disabled, and committing/busy.
- **Accessibility:** accessible name includes the task title; native disabled semantics when DnD permits, plus `aria-disabled`/`aria-busy` when committing.

### Conflict notice

- **Structure:** warning-toned status banner with message and optional refresh/retry-safe action.
- **States:** hidden, reconciling, resolved, and persistent error.
- **Copy:** stale moves say “Board changed while you were dragging; refreshed to the latest version.”
- **Accessibility:** `role="status"` for reconciliation and `role="alert"` only when user action is required.

### Agent scope navigation

- **Structure:** scope is represented only in the application shell. `Main Chat` appears immediately after the Project switcher and before the `Project` section label. The selected Project contributes one `Agent Workspace` entry within that section. `Agent Settings` appears once in `Workspace`; chat pages never render a second global/Project roster.
- **Order:** Project switcher; Main Chat; Project label and Overview, Board, Tasks, Agent Workspace, Project Settings; Workspace label and Agent Settings, Mission Control, Daemons, Operations, Forge Settings.
- **States:** active, ready, setup required, loading, unavailable, and empty Project selection. Setup status stays visible on the destination surface rather than adding a duplicate navigation model.
- **Accessibility:** entries are semantic links with `aria-current="page"`, visible focus rings, and names that include scope where needed. The compact drawer preserves the same order, closes on activation, and restores focus to its trigger.
- **Responsive:** the full sidebar, compact rail, and overlay drawer expose the same hierarchy. Navigation never creates document-wide horizontal overflow.

### Agent chat timeline and composer

- **Structure:** server-authoritative Agent Chat messages, explicit handoffs, and one composer. Do not derive handoffs or target navigation from message text, task IDs, or retired Room/Conversation aliases.
- **Turn states:** finite `sending`, `queued`, `leased`, `running`, `retry_wait`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled` states are visible in the timeline and announced with `role="status"` or `role="alert"` as appropriate.
- **Composer behavior:** Enter submits a non-composing message; Shift+Enter inserts a newline; IME composition is never interrupted. The send control is disabled while the current turn is live or the binding is not ready, with truthful copy explaining why.
- **Handoffs:** a handoff's Continue action opens the target Project Agent Chat and never redirects to a board/task view. Context provenance remains inspectable from the explicit manifest identifier.
- **States:** loading, recoverable error with retry, empty timeline, setup required, pending turn, and settled timeline all have explicit copy and keyboard-visible actions.
- **Refresh:** server events may accelerate updates, but mounted timelines poll messages, turns, handoffs, and chat status at a bounded interval so a completed response never depends on an unavailable event channel.

### Project Agent Workspace

- **Structure:** `/projects/:projectId/chat` is titled `Agent Workspace` and identifies the active Project and bound Project Agent. At desktop it pairs the durable timeline with a bounded editing rail for Project summary/status, Decisions, artifacts, milestones, and Tasks. All mutations use typed Forge services and return a durable receipt.
- **Edit states:** every editor exposes idle, dirty, saving, saved, conflict, and failed outcomes without collapsing geometry. A conflict preserves the user's draft and shows the current server revision; it never silently overwrites or retries.
- **Authority:** the surface never exposes a repository path, worktree, shell, raw filesystem tool, or Workspace lease. Repository work is represented as a traceable Task for an authorized Task Worker or reviewer.
- **Responsive:** at 1280px, use conversation plus a bounded editing rail; at 768px and 375px, use a labeled `Conversation` / `Project` segmented view. Segment changes preserve drafts and focus context and warn before abandoning unsaved changes.
- **Accessibility:** the segment control follows the tab pattern, mutation results use polite status announcements, actionable failures use alerts, and saved receipts remain inspectable from the timeline or editing rail.

### Global chat launcher

- **Structure:** a bottom-right launcher opens the same account-owned Main Agent timeline as `/chat`; it never creates a second chat or local fork.
- **Accessibility:** the launcher has an accessible name, Escape closes the panel, focus moves into the panel on open, and focus returns to the launcher on close. The panel is responsive to viewport height and keeps the composer reachable above the safe area.

### Settings tab bar

- **Structure:** a `role="tablist"` row of `role="tab"` buttons controlling named tab panels; each tab is a text label plus a mono count badge.
- **States:** the active tab uses foreground text, an ember underline indicator (`bg-primary`), and an ember-tinted count badge (`ember-surface`/`ember-border`); inactive tabs are muted with hover to foreground; keyboard focus uses the `ring` token.
- **Motion:** color transitions only, micro timing.
- **Accessibility:** `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` wire tabs to panels; counts are part of the accessible label.
- **Responsive:** tabs wrap within their own row and never cause page-level overflow.

### Canonical Agent Settings and binding controls

- **Structure:** `/agents` is the only agent configuration destination, organized as three tabs over one settings model. The `Providers` tab is an inventory of configured provider entries (multiple entries per provider type are allowed) plus a `CLI runtimes` group for harnesses discovered on connected runtimes; the `Agents` tab is the searchable/filterable roster with connection health and profile activation; the `Bindings` tab holds the account's Main Agent binding, the optional Project Agent binding, and the read-only Main/Project chat-scope list. Project links may add a non-authoritative `project` query parameter that opens the Bindings tab, and a `tab` query parameter may deep-link any tab.
- **Provider entries:** each card shows provider type, editable display name, credential method, redacted account identity, endpoint, connection status, usage (which agents reference it and when it was last used), a live connection test, and rename/disconnect actions. Disconnecting warns with the dependent agent list first; dependents become visibly unhealthy and are never silently rebound. CLI runtime cards show authentication availability, host, version, usage, and a login-command hint instead of a credential form.
- **Provider setup wizard:** `Add provider` is a four-step wizard — choose a provider from the server catalog, choose an authentication method (guided login never replaces an available API-key path), connect (API-key form or the public OAuth operation view), then verify. The verify step confirms the stored entry, auto-runs the connection test, and offers agent creation as an explicit follow-up; completing a connection never creates an agent.
- **Connection test:** idle, testing, responding (with round-trip latency), and failed states are text plus structure in a `role="status"` region. The failure reason is server-redacted (HTTP class or transport kind only) and a retry stays keyboard-visible; secrets and provider response bodies never render.
- **Agent registration:** `New agent` is a three-step wizard — authentication source (a provider entry or CLI-managed runtime, with an inline add-provider path), runtime (`Direct · built-in runtime` or a harness, enabled/disabled by the server capability matrix with the server's reason shown), then configure (name, model, prompt). Completing a provider connection never creates an agent; the success state offers agent creation as an explicit follow-up.
- **Actions:** add/rename/disconnect a provider entry, create an agent, publish a replacement profile on another entry, activate a profile revision, select exactly one Main identity/profile through `/account/main-agent`, and select exactly one Project identity/profile through `/projects/{id}/project-agent`. Provider authorization, agent creation, and binding remain three separate operations.
- **Truthfulness:** controls show server state and expected version, preserve optimistic-concurrency errors, and display the server-enforced permission ceiling as read-only metadata. Forge-wide runtime defaults remain under `Forge Settings`. Role, primary/steward, participant, archive-membership, and arbitrary capability-grant controls are not part of this surface.
- **States:** loading inventory, empty/filter-empty, connected, authorization pending, refresh required, disconnected, unavailable, stale version, and recoverable failure each have explicit copy and a keyboard-visible next action.
- **Responsive:** filters wrap without truncating scope; inventory becomes one ordered column at compact widths; dialogs keep the primary action and operation status reachable above the safe area.

### Provider capability and connection controls

- **Provider card:** name, support level (`stable`, `experimental`, or `unavailable`), model-discovery support, configuration readiness, and only the credential methods declared by the server. Each method also declares which runtimes its entries can drive (`direct` or harness kinds) with per-combination support levels; the client renders — and disables with the server's reason — from that matrix and never infers compatibility from provider names. Guided login never visually replaces the API-key alternative when both are available.
- **Methods:** `Continue with ChatGPT` uses browser authorization with a device fallback and carries an experimental label; `Continue with xAI` uses a device flow and carries an experimental label; `Continue with Google` is available only for a registered Forge Gemini API OAuth client; OpenRouter and OpenAI-compatible providers use API-key forms.
- **Operation states:** starting, awaiting browser, awaiting device confirmation, polling, exchanging, verifying, publishing, succeeded, denied, expired, cancelled, and failed. Public views show only the opaque operation ID, public URL/code, expiry/polling guidance, and redacted error/recovery copy.
- **Credential states:** API key, renewable OAuth, refreshing, refresh failed, revoked, and disconnected are represented by text plus structure. Secret values, authorization codes, refresh tokens, device secrets, and PKCE material never render, enter URLs owned by Forge, or appear in debug details.
- **Accessibility:** provider method selection uses labeled controls; status changes are announced without stealing focus; the device code has an explicit copy action and readable fallback; cancellation remains available until terminal state; successful completion returns focus to the connected provider card.

### Mission Control and Agent detail

- **Hierarchy:** primary views lead with the singular Main binding, one Project binding per authorized Project, relevant Task Worker/reviewer activity, Attention, and outcomes. Connected profiles without a binding or active Task scope stay in secondary configuration inventory.
- **Scope isolation:** a Project Agent view requests only its Project's handoff metadata; the Main timeline may show explicit handoff receipts but never imports Project-private history or memory.
- **Recovery:** live chat turns expose a server-versioned “Cancel turn” action using an idempotency key; terminal turns expose only a bounded “Retry turn” action that re-admits the same request through normal server policy. Leased, queued, and retry-wait turns remain server-controlled and do not expose an unbounded client retry.
- **Containment:** long message, identifier, and error content wraps inside the timeline; the timeline owns horizontal clipping and never creates page-level overflow.

### Charter, Project Overview, and release primitives

These primitives extend the existing card, panel, button, form, status, and chat patterns. They introduce no new semantic color, typography, spacing, motion, or depth tokens: use the semantic tokens in Sections 2–4 and the existing depth levels in Section 7. Status is always conveyed by text and structure as well as color; Phosphor icons may reinforce it, but never replace the label.

#### Shared state contract

Every primitive in this section exposes the following states. State changes use the motion rules in Section 6 and preserve the component's geometry so surrounding content does not jump.

| State             | Surface and behavior                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default           | `card`/`background` surface, `border-subtle`, normal text hierarchy, canonical current content.                                                                                                              |
| Hover             | Only actionable rows/cards change to `shadow-card-hover` and a subtle border/`accent` shift; non-actionable content does not pretend to be clickable.                                                        |
| Active            | Pressed/selected/current scope uses `ember-surface`, `ember-border`, and `shadow-ember`; the text label remains explicit.                                                                                    |
| Focus             | Keyboard focus uses the existing `ring` token and a visible outline/offset; focus never relies on hover or color alone.                                                                                      |
| Disabled          | Native `disabled` where possible, muted text/surface, `aria-disabled` when a non-form control must remain inspectable, and copy explaining why the action is unavailable.                                    |
| Loading           | A geometry-preserving skeleton and `aria-busy="true"`; retain the section heading and scope so loading is not mistaken for an empty or approved result.                                                      |
| Empty             | A short reason, the scope that is empty, and one safe next action in a `muted` surface; never render a blank panel.                                                                                          |
| Error             | Inline `destructive` status with a safe retry or route; use `role="alert"` only when the user must act and keep the last known content visibly marked as not current.                                        |
| Stale             | `warning` treatment with the source revision/event watermark and refresh/reconcile action; cached content must not carry a current, ready, or released claim.                                                |
| Conflict          | Show the conflicting record/revision or content/render digest, preserve both choices for inspection, and require refresh/explicit resolution; never silently merge, overwrite, or retry against newer truth. |
| Setup required    | Explain the missing setup and the exact route/action (for example `charter_setup_required`); keep unrelated existing Project Tasks, chat, evidence, and document maintenance usable.                         |
| Permission denied | Do not reveal protected bodies, identifiers, filenames, digests, counts, or media existence; show a bounded denial and the safe authorized route.                                                            |

#### Responsive composition contract

All primitives use `min-width: 0`, wrap long labels/identifiers, and keep horizontal clipping inside the owning region. At 1280px, use bounded side rails and side-by-side comparisons where noted; at 768px, collapse to one ordered column and wrap controls without hiding the next action; at 375px, stack actions/content, use full-width primary actions, and contain only explicitly bounded galleries or diff panes. The singular Main/Project Chat navigation and reachable composer remain intact at every width.

#### Charter knowledge label

- **Structure:** a compact inline label or ledger row with the epistemic category, short claim, source/revision reference, and optional impact. Categories are exactly `observed fact`, `user decision`, `research finding`, `assumption`, `hypothesis`, and `open decision`; do not collapse them into a generic “insight” tag.
- **Treatment:** use `text-micro` mono overlines for the category, `text-ui` for the claim, and `text-xs` mono for revision/source IDs. Labels use text plus a shape/icon cue; `user decision` and approved content may use the ember treatment, unresolved/open items may use `warning`, and observed/research content remains neutral unless a source is stale or conflicting.
- **Interaction:** hover/focus reveals the bounded source/provenance popover; active opens the ledger item or filters the diff/readiness view; disabled labels remain readable when the source is not actionable. Long claims and IDs wrap with `min-width: 0` and `overflow-wrap: anywhere`.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. In `stale`, show the superseded revision and do not promote the claim; in `conflict`, show the competing sources and affected authority domain; in `setup-required`, show the adoption-Charter action; in `permission-denied`, show only the category-level denial.
- **Accessibility:** use a named list/region, expose the category in accessible text, and announce changes to readiness or approval without moving focus.

#### Charter revision diff

- **Structure:** revision header (Charter ID, revision number, base revision, author/provenance, content digest, rendered-view digest), material change summary, and a semantic diff grouped by Charter section. Additions and removals use text labels/icons and restrained `success`/`destructive` treatments; never rely on red/green alone. Provide unified view by default and a side-by-side comparison at wide desktop.
- **Controls:** revision selector, “inspect source”/provenance action, and a bounded `Approve exact Charter revision` action owned by the approval block below. Do not label an action “approve latest.”
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `empty` means there is no prior revision and renders an “initial Charter” explanation; `stale` means the candidate is no longer current; `conflict` shows the submitted and server content/render digests side by side and disables approval until refreshed; `setup-required` explains that an existing Project needs explicit Charter adoption; `permission-denied` hides diff bodies and digests.
- **Responsive:** at 1280px, keep a two-pane diff with synchronized section headings; at 768px, use one pane with a base/candidate toggle and a persistent change summary; at 375px, use a unified inline diff, wrap IDs, and keep revision/action controls stacked without page overflow.

#### Charter readiness and exact approval

- **Structure:** a readiness summary beside the candidate diff: maturity/mode, required-section checklist, typed gaps, unresolved-item queue, material risks, exact content/render digests, selected Project Agent identity/profile/operating-skill revisions, and a single primary approval action. A ready state must still show assumptions, waivers, and unresolved items.
- **Readiness statuses:** `ready` uses an explicit “Ready for approval” label; `blocked`/`failed` list typed gaps; `stale` identifies the changed source; `conflict` identifies the expected/current version; none of these states becomes approval-ready through field count alone.
- **Exact approval rule:** the primary button reads `Approve exact Charter revision`; it is enabled only when the displayed revision, both digests, expected version, and selected responder revisions match the server candidate. Confirmation names the revision and digests, records the user's explicit event, and then offers the existing `Continue with Project Agent` navigation after the atomic handoff. Silence, continued chat, agent output, or Task progress never enables it.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `loading` preserves the checklist shape; `empty` explains which maturity-specific information is not yet known; `error` offers retry without changing the draft; `stale`/`conflict` disable approval and require a refreshed diff; `setup-required` routes to adoption rather than implying approval; `permission-denied` hides approval metadata and the action.
- **Accessibility:** checklist items expose pass/gap text, not color alone; approval has a descriptive label containing the revision, is keyboard reachable, and announces success/failure in a polite status region. A failed or stale approval never moves focus to an unrelated chat.

#### Project Overview and current outcome

- **Structure:** one Overview landmark with a header (Project name, vision, current approved Charter revision, active milestone labels, explicit `primary_milestone_id`), one next user action, a current-outcome rail, authoritative Task/validation counts, Documents and Decision risks, bounded Evidence, immutable Release history, and links to the singular Project Agent Chat/global Main Chat. Keep live progress and released truth in separate titled surfaces.
- **Current outcome card:** show the milestone identity/outcome, included and excluded scope, lifecycle, blockers, check counts, evidence coverage, and concrete Task counts by workflow state. Ember marks current active work; success marks an actual passing/released result; warning marks stale/waived data. Never render an editable percentage or a released badge from terminal Task counts alone.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract to the Overview and current-outcome card. `empty` is a Project with no active milestone and names the next setup action; `setup-required` explains adoption while keeping Tasks/chat/evidence usable; `stale` shows the projection watermark and separates cached progress from release truth; `conflict` names the affected authority domain; `permission-denied` preserves navigation but withholds protected Project details.
- **Responsive:** at 1280px, use a main outcome/status column with a bounded right rail for Decisions/Evidence/Release history; at 768px, collapse to one ordered column with the next action and outcome first; at 375px, stack header actions, wrap labels/identifiers, keep the composer/deep links reachable, and contain any horizontal gallery inside its own region. The page itself never scrolls horizontally.

#### Project Document freshness and Decision/Risk panel

- **Document row/card:** show typed kind, title, current draft and approved revision pointers, approval policy, change summary, author/provenance, digest, and a freshness marker. Actions are inspect, compare, and (when authorized) propose/approve; an exported repository copy is visibly derived and never presented as canonical.
- **Decision/Risk row:** show the question/context, selected outcome or unresolved choice, alternatives, rationale, principal/decision class, affected Document/Task/Milestone IDs, risk/impact, and `active`/`superseded`/`invalidated` effective status. Proposal/editor records are visibly separate from effective DecisionRecords. Use `open decision`, `assumption`, and `hypothesis` labels rather than presenting them as approvals.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `empty` explains that optional Documents are intentionally absent for compact Projects and that no risk is currently recorded; `loading` keeps revision/status columns visible; `error` has a safe retry; `stale` marks a superseded pointer or stale memory reference; `conflict` shows the base/current revision and blocks overwrite; `setup-required` permits document maintenance but routes Charter adoption; `permission-denied` hides document bodies and decision details while retaining a safe count only when policy permits.
- **Responsive/accessibility:** at 1280px, keep Documents and Decisions as separate bounded panels in the Overview rail; at 768px and 375px, render them as full-width stacked sections. Each row is a named button/link only when actionable, wraps digests/IDs, and exposes status, principal, and freshness in accessible text.

#### Milestone outcome, acceptance checks, and readiness

- **Milestone outcome card:** show canonical sequence (`M001`), optional human label, lifecycle (`planned`, `active`, `ready_for_release`, `released`, `cancelled`), explicit primary/active marker, outcome, included/excluded scope, linked artifacts/Tasks, dependencies, risks, and evidence expectation. Multiple active milestones remain visible; `primary_milestone_id` changes emphasis only.
- **Acceptance check row/matrix:** each check has stable ID, description, required/optional marker, source kind, expected result, exact source revision, and current result/provenance. Render `passed`, `failed`, `missing`, `stale`, `blocked`, and `waived` as distinct text states; waived checks retain the authorized user, reason, and time and never look like ordinary passes.
- **Readiness panel:** show the immutable `ReadinessSnapshot` ID/digest, candidate milestone/definition revision, event watermark, ordered inputs, check results, evidence attachment IDs/digests/availability, blockers, known issues, and the next safe action. `ready_for_release` is a release candidate, not a release; only an authorized user may see an enabled exact release action.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `empty` explains missing checks/evidence; `loading` preserves check-row geometry; `error` offers retry; `stale` returns an unreleased milestone to `active` with typed reasons; `conflict` shows expected/current milestone or readiness versions; `setup-required` blocks release only when the Project lacks an approved Charter; `permission-denied` hides check inputs and release metadata. A `released` milestone stays released while correction readiness is evaluated, and `cancelled` is terminal/muted.
- **Responsive/accessibility:** at 1280px, show the outcome card beside the check/readiness panel; at 768px, stack outcome, checks, then readiness; at 375px, use one-column cards with wrapped IDs and a full-width next action. Checks are a named list/table with status text, not color-only badges; readiness updates use `role="status"` and release errors use `role="alert"` only when action is required.

#### Bounded Evidence gallery and media tile

- **Structure:** a named, Project-authorized gallery of bounded image/video tiles. Each tile includes an image thumbnail or video poster, fixed aspect ratio, caption, evidence kind, source Task/run/validation when present, supported acceptance-check IDs, uploader/time, checksum/freshness, availability, and explicit open/download/play controls. Use `object-fit: cover` for previews; video never autoplays and always exposes poster and duration.
- **Availability:** `available` can render and count; `quarantined` shows pending review and cannot render/count as proof; `redacted` explains that only a policy-permitted derivative/metadata is available; `purged` shows an immutable tombstone/digest/audit note and `evidence_unavailable` rather than a broken image. The gallery exposes no inline purge control; an authorized Project owner/admin disposition uses the explicit media route and the resulting status is rendered as unavailable evidence. A missing caption or check linkage can remain stored but does not satisfy the acceptance check.
- **Interaction:** hover reveals only the bounded action overlay; active opens the authorized detail view; focus makes every open/download/play action visible with the existing ring. Captions, source, and check linkage remain visible outside the overlay for keyboard and screen-reader users.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `empty` names whether no evidence is attached or required; `loading` uses aspect-ratio-preserving tiles; `error` offers retry per tile/gallery; `stale` marks outdated evidence and its source revision; `conflict` shows attachment/version mismatch without replacing the asset; `setup-required` explains Charter adoption while leaving evidence capture available; `permission-denied` reveals no filename, URL, checksum, or existence.
- **Responsive:** at 1280px, use a bounded grid in the right rail or outcome section; at 768px, use two columns under the outcome; at 375px, use a contained horizontal gallery with snap/keyboard movement and an overflow affordance inside the gallery only. Preview bounds, captions, and long media titles never create page-level overflow.

#### Immutable Release snapshot and history

- **Snapshot card/history item:** show immutable release revision (`M001-r1`), milestone definition/digest, display label, released-at/principal, summary/changelog, known issues, exact Charter/Document revisions, included Decisions/Tasks/validation outcomes, bounded git/repository references, evidence asset/attachment IDs/checksums/availability, waivers, and whole-snapshot digest. Use a chronological list with an inspect action; no edit/delete affordance is rendered.
- **Live separation:** place current Project outcome and release history in separately titled surfaces. A later Task, Document, branch, caption, or milestone change updates live surfaces only; it never rewrites an earlier snapshot. Corrections append `M001-r2` and retain `M001-r1` byte-for-byte. When the server supplies an audited purge tombstone, released evidence remains visible as unavailable evidence, not silently removed.
- **Release action:** the action names the exact readiness candidate/digest and is enabled only for an authorized user after the release transaction's source re-check. Project Agent proposals and a `ready_for_release` badge never release automatically.
- **States:** apply the shared state contract. `empty` explains that no release exists yet and points to readiness; `loading` preserves the history timeline; `error` offers retry; `stale` marks live data as newer than the selected snapshot without changing snapshot text; `conflict` shows the candidate/source digest mismatch and blocks release; `setup-required` explains that Charter adoption is required before release; `permission-denied` hides snapshot bodies/digests and any protected evidence metadata while preserving only the safe route.
- **Responsive/accessibility:** at 1280px, keep current outcome and history side by side; at 768px, stack them with current state first; at 375px, stack metadata, summary, known issues, and inspect action, wrap all IDs/digests, and keep the history list contained. Each snapshot has a named heading, release number, actor/time, and immutable warning in accessible text.

## 6. Motion & Interaction

| Token     |  Duration | Easing                          | Usage                                        |
| --------- | --------: | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Micro     | 100–150ms | `ease-out`                      | Hover, active press, focus visibility, menus |
| Standard  |     200ms | `ease-in-out`                   | Sidebar/rail and drawer state changes        |
| Emphasis  | 400–600ms | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Reserved for meaningful page-level emphasis  |
| Live work |    2200ms | `ease-in-out`                   | Existing in-progress ember pulse             |

- Animate transform, opacity, filter, color, border color, and tokenized shadow only; never animate layout dimensions or positions.
- Every interactive element has hover, active, and focus-visible treatment.
- Drag start freezes an ID-keyed board snapshot. Updates queue until commit/reconciliation, and a second gesture cannot start while a move is committing.
- Conflicts never auto-retry against newer versions; current server truth replaces the frozen snapshot and the result is announced.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; all core state meaning remains visible without animation.

## 7. Depth & Surface

Forge uses a **mixed border-and-soft-shadow** strategy. Warm tonal shifts define the shell and column hierarchy; subtle borders define card edges; soft shadows communicate card lift and floating surfaces.

| Level        | Token                                | Usage                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Hairline     | `border-subtle`                      | Columns and quiet cards              |
| Default      | `border`                             | Inputs and emphasized separators     |
| Rest         | `shadow-xs`, `shadow-soft`           | Controls and cards at rest           |
| Hover        | `shadow-card-hover`                  | Interactive card lift                |
| Floating     | `shadow-float`                       | Menus, dialogs, overlay navigation   |
| Active ember | `shadow-ember`, ember surface/border | Current work, focus, and drag intent |

New surfaces must reuse these levels. The current code contains a few legacy literal status colors, arbitrary compact measurements, and generic `shadow-sm`/`shadow-lg` utilities; they are accepted debt outside this change and should be consolidated only in separately approved work.
